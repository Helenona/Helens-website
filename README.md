# Helen Onanusi — Website Prototype

This repository contains a 5-page hand-coded website created for the web application development assessment (CRN 59135).

## Structure
- `index.html` — Home
- `skills.html` — Skills
- `showcase.html` — Business Showcase (three projects + design rationale)
- `problem-solving.html` — Restaurant case study (interactive form that generates an email)
- `contact.html` — Contact information
- `css/style.css` — Styles
- `js/main.js` — JavaScript (form handling + interactivity)

## Deploy
You can deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a public repository and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. In repository settings → Pages, select `main` branch and root folder, save.
3. The site will be available at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

Alternatively you can deploy on Vercel (recommended for nice performance) — connect repo to Vercel and deploy.

## W3C/Validation
- Validate HTML at https://validator.w3.org/ and CSS at https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ before submission. Fix any minor warnings.

## AI Usage Statement (example)
I used ChatGPT to:
- generate example CSS and layout ideas,
- draft the content for the project descriptions,
- get suggestions for accessible form behaviour.

I adapted and rewrote all code to ensure it reflects my own work and understanding. Any AI-generated snippets were reviewed and modified manually.

(Replace this block with your actual, specific statement about tools used and how you adapted outputs.)

## Notes
- Make sure to replace placeholder contact emails (e.g., `restaurant@example.com`) with real addresses before submitting.
- Add scanned certificates in the Skills page if required for marks.
